Made all changes through various branches with numerous commits. And then merged them together:

I am new to using these features since I have never collaberated with anyone before and never needed to use git this way. As a result I struggled at first and made a lot of mistakes with commits and branches. However over time I became more comfortable and tried to only commit specific changes. Although at first things were a little awkward for me.

I have also changed the over all lay out of design using flex and grid. I also added in media queries as well as modifying the print option to print out a more readable resume. I added a picture and changed the design of the socials and skills. I also tweaked a font to make it look more presentable in this form. In the css I added in variables, as well as some math functions. I used gpt to help a lot with the icons as well as with the css. However I found myself having to debug a bit, and fixing it up to make it look nicer and work. I also made use of :hover to make it a tad bit more interactive. For the header I added the green-blue background and chose font colors that would keep the same (explorer type) vibe. But I also made sure that the contrast was okay and that it was easily accessible towards anyone with visual imparments.
